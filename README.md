## With the React Weather App you can 

- Search your home city - or any city for that matter
- The country in which the city is in
- click search
- Voila!
- You will be displayed with an overview of the weather for the current day and time
- The weather is broken down into these categories
> Location
>> Temperature
>>> Humidity
>>> and a small description of the weather

## What did I learn?

- How to use `await` and `async` in react
- How tp use Hooks in react 
- How to call an external API from react components
- Got a better understanding of how data is flowing between the components
- you can figure anything out if you break it down into smaller and smaller chunks
